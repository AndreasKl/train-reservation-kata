# booking reference service

Generates booking reference numbers. Instead of simply generating an ID it is more advanced than it needs to be to demonstrate the use of a structured logging, tracing etc. 

## TODO
- Document the API
- Add tracing via open-telementy
- Add a more sophisticated way to configure the service
- Add non-structured logging in dev mode
